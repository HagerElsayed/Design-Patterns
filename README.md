its one of a <b>Behavioral Patterns</b> because it's all about objects communication[one-to-one] which consist of three parts:
- <b>Delegating object:</b> Itâ€™s the object that has a delegate. The delegate is usually held as a weak property to avoid a retain cycle.
- <b>Delegate protocol:</b> which defines the methods that the delegate should implement.
- <b>Delegate:</b> This is the helper object that implements the delegate protocol.

its one of a <b>Behavioral Patterns</b> which consist of four parts:
- <b>Client:</b> Object using an adapter and depends on the protocol
- <b>protocol:</b> which defines the methods we need 
- <b>Adaptee/legacy object:</b> cannot be modified directly so we need add extension or create new adapter
- <b>adapter:</b> which helps us to make the incompatible objects deal with each other
